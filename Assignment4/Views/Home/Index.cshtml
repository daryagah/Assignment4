                    Healthcare costs in the U.S. are among the highest in the world in all categories.
                    The U.S. is an outlier in terms of per capita health care spending. In 2016, per capita health care was $9,892.
                    It was about 25 percent higher than second-place Switzerland’s $7,919.
                    It was also 108 percent higher than Canada’s $4,753, and 145 percent higher than the Organization
                    for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median of $4,033. <br /><br />
                    Medicare is the national health insurance program in the United States. <br /><br />
                    The data provided here is from data.cms.gov. It includes hospital-specific charges for the more than
                    3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for
                    the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using
                    the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent
                    more than 7 million discharges or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges. <br /><br />
